            <div class="round"><h2>HOW ARE NOMINEES SELECTED?</h2>
                <h3>​​​Nominees for most categories of The Game Awards are chosen by an international jury of over 100 global media and influencer outlets, selected for their history of critical video game evaluation.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="round"><h2>HOW ARE WINNERS SELECTED?</h2>
                <h3>Winners are determined by a blended vote between the voting jury (90%) and public fan voting (10%).</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="round"><h2>WHY DON’T FANS 100% SELECT THE WINNERS?</h2>
                <h3>First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles. In addition, it is important that winners cannot be “socially engineered” in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners.</h3>            
            </div>
            <div class="round"><h2>ARE EARLY ACCESS GAMES ELIGIBLE FOR NOMINATION?</h2>
                <h3>Yes, any game available for public consumption by the deadline is eligible for potential nomination. It’s up to the jury to decide if a title warrants a nomination for creative and/or technical excellence in a given year.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="round"><h2>HOW DO I SUBMIT A GAME FOR CONSIDERATION?</h2>
                <h3>There is no formal submission process for The Game Awards. Qualified developers and publishers can contact The Game Awards to receive the list of voting outlets.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="round"><h2>ARE GAME COMPANIES MADE AWARE OF NOMINEES/WINNERS IN ADVANCE?</h2>
                <h3>No, game developers and publishers, including the Advisory Board, find out the nominees and winners at the same time as the public. The Game Awards does not disclose winners in advance of the live ceremony. There are no exceptions to this rule.</h3>
